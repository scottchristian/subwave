# Testing the SUB/WAVE app on iOS and Android

How to build, run, and test the Expo app on simulators/emulators, physical
devices, and via EAS cloud builds. Read the **Architecture-critical facts**
section first — one wrong toggle and playback crashes on launch.

---

## Architecture-critical facts (read before changing native config)

### Both platforms run the New Architecture — it's mandatory in RN 0.86

RN 0.82+ **removed the ability to opt out** of the New Architecture. Both
platforms run it ON, and this is required (Reanimated 4.5.1 only works under new
arch):

- **iOS** — `Info.plist RCTNewArchEnabled = true`, Pods built `-DRCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1`.
- **Android** — a generated `android/gradle.properties` may carry a leftover
  `newArchEnabled=false`, but **Gradle ignores it** and prints:
  `Setting newArchEnabled=false … is not supported anymore since React Native 0.82
  … The application will run with the New Architecture enabled by default.`
  The line is a harmless no-op; you can delete it.

`app.json` no longer declares `newArchEnabled` (it used to say `false` — equally
a no-op). Don't rely on such flags anywhere; they do nothing on this RN version.

### Why `react-native-track-player` still works under new arch

RNTP 4.1.2 is not natively New-Architecture-compatible — out of the box, Android
playback crashes with `You should not use ReactNativeHost directly in the New
Architecture` from `MusicService`. **The fix is `patches/react-native-track-player+4.1.2.patch`**,
which makes two source edits:

- `MusicModule.kt` — routes async `@ReactMethod`s through a Unit-returning
  `launch` helper (TurboModule interop requires void-returning async methods).
- `MusicService.kt` — `currentReactContextCompat()` obtains the `ReactContext`
  from `ReactHost` (new arch) instead of the `ReactNativeHost.reactInstanceManager`
  path that throws, with an old-arch fallback.

> Do not delete this patch. Without it, Android RNTP crashes on the first
> playback event. iOS (SwiftAudioEx path) is unaffected by the crash but the
> patch is harmless there. Validated: Android `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` and iOS live
> playback both with the patch applied.

### Other load-bearing facts

- **Expo Go does not work** — native modules (RNTP, Skia, Reanimated worklets)
  ship compiled code. You must build a **dev client**.
- **MP3 is the default** (`{base}/stream.mp3`). The SIGNAL picker offers AAC on
  both platforms and Opus/FLAC on Android when the station advertises the mount.
  iOS cannot demux Ogg. Cast always uses MP3.
- **No backend needed for testing** — the app defaults to the public
  `getsubwave.com` station, which is live. Onboarding pre-fills it.
- **Base URL is fully runtime** — there are no hardcoded station URLs in source.
  All API/stream URLs come from `StationContext` → `createApi(baseUrl)`.
- **Cast + AirPlay need physical hardware.** Neither Google Cast discovery nor
  the AirPlay picker works in a simulator/emulator — test with a real phone and
  a Chromecast/Nest (or HomePod/Apple TV) on the **same Wi-Fi**. On iOS the
  first tap of the cast button triggers the Local Network permission prompt
  (deny = no devices found, ever — reset via Settings → Privacy → Local
  Network). Cast hands playback OFF the phone: while a session is connected,
  RNTP is torn down and the phone is a remote — expect no lock-screen media
  controls, and the deck's Signal cell reads `Cast · <device>`.
  `react-native-google-cast` runs under the New Architecture in **compat
  (interop) mode** (v5 will be native); if a Cast API breaks after an RN/Expo
  upgrade, check the library's v5 status before patching.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Needed for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node 20+ / npm | everything | `npm install` (uses `legacy-peer-deps`, set in `.npmrc`) |
| Xcode 16+ + CocoaPods | iOS sim/device | `xcode-select --install`, `sudo gem install cocoapods` |
| **JDK 17** | Android build | `brew install openjdk@17`. **Not** JDK 21 (Android Studio's JBR) — it fails the Gradle build with a JVM-target mismatch. |
| Android SDK + an AVD | Android emulator | via Android Studio; emulator binary at `$ANDROID_HOME/emulator` |

First-time setup:

```bash
cd app
npm install        # postinstall applies patches/ via patch-package
```

---

## Local testing — iOS simulator

The fast inner loop. No Apple Developer account required.

```bash
cd app

# Build, install, and launch on a booted simulator.
# (Boot one first via: open -a Simulator)
npx expo run:ios

# If run:ios skips the dev server (non-interactive shells do), start Metro
# yourself and open the installed app pointed at localhost:
npx expo start --dev-client --port 8081 &
xcrun simctl openurl <SIM_UDID> \
  "exp+subwave://expo-development-client/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8081"
```

**Use `localhost`, not the LAN IP**, in the deep link for simulators — the LAN
IP can time out (`xcrun simctl openurl ... code: 60`).

**Verified working** (2026-06): builds clean (0 errors), bundles 4075 modules,
renders onboarding → health check (all 4 probes OK against live getsubwave.com)
→ player with live audio (NOW PLAYING timer advances), runtime theming, cover
art, and the Skia spectrum.

---

## Local testing — Android emulator

```bash
cd app

# Boot an AVD (list them: $ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -list-avds)
$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -avd <AVD_NAME> &

# Build with JDK 17 — single connected emulator is auto-selected.
# DO NOT pass `--device <adb-serial>`; expo wants an AVD name, not emulator-5554.
JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17 npx expo run:android
```

If the dev client opens against the LAN IP and can't reach Metro, set the
reverse tunnel and relaunch via localhost:

```bash
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW \
  -d "exp+subwave://expo-development-client/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8081" \
  com.getsubwave.app
adb exec-out screencap -p > /tmp/screen.png   # always screenshot to verify
```

**Verified working** (2026-06): `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` with JDK 17 (new arch ON, via
the RNTP patch), debug APK installed on the emulator. (Physical-device run is
covered and proven by the `subwave-app-android` skill — see below.)

---

## Physical devices

### Android phone — use the `subwave-app-android` skill

The repo ships a skill (`.claude/skills/subwave-app-android/`) that automates
getting the app onto a connected Pixel, in two modes:

- **Dev / USB** — dev-client app loads live JS from Metro over `adb reverse`;
  hot-reload while tethered.
- **Release / embedded** — self-contained release APK (`./gradlew assembleRelease`
  with **JDK 17**) that runs unplugged over WiFi/cellular.

It handles the JDK-17 gotcha, the Metro tunnel, the deep link, and screenshots
to verify. The release APK is signed with the **debug keystore** — fine for
sideloading, **not** for Play Store.

### iOS device

Two options:
1. **Local** — open `ios/SUBWAVE.xcworkspace` in Xcode, select your device,
   set a development team (Signing & Capabilities), run. Needs a free or paid
   Apple ID for on-device signing.
2. **EAS** — `eas build --profile development-device --platform ios` (see below).

Background audio (lock screen / CarPlay / headphones) and metadata can only be
properly judged on a **physical device** — the remote-control wiring lives in
`service.ts` (Play/Pause/Stop; Next/Seek intentionally omitted for a live
stream).

### CarPlay — Now-Playing in the car (iOS only)

Scope is **Tier 1**: control the *already-playing* stream from the dash (metadata,
artwork, play/pause/stop). There is **no launchable in-car app icon** — start the
stream in the phone app first, then connect the car. RNTP feeds the iOS surface
(`MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`), so CarPlay needs **no extra app-side wiring**.

- **iOS** — run on a device, or use the **CarPlay Simulator** (Simulator app →
  **I/O → External Displays → CarPlay**). Start the stream, open the CarPlay
  screen → SUB/WAVE shows under **Now Playing** with title/artist/album + artwork;
  Play/Pause work; no scrubber (the `isLiveStream` track hides it).

> **Android Auto is intentionally not declared.** The earlier
> `plugins/withAndroidAuto.js` declaration (#444) was **rejected by Google Play**
> (20 Jun 2026) under the Auto App Quality Guidelines: media apps that use a TTS
> engine to read out content aren't permitted on Android Auto, which is exactly
> what SUB/WAVE's AI DJ does. The declaration was removed so the Android build
> stays Play-compliant. iOS CarPlay is unaffected (separate `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`
> path, no manifest declaration). Revisit only if Google's policy changes **and**
> a compliant `MediaBrowserService` browse tree is added.

### Live Activity — Lock Screen, Dynamic Island, Apple Watch (iOS only)

The on-air card. A **widget extension target** (`targets/live-activity/`, wired by
`@bacons/apple-targets`) plus a **local Expo module** (`modules/live-activity/`)
that drives ActivityKit, started and stopped by `src/hooks/useLiveActivity.ts`.

The reason it exists is the **Apple Watch**: React Native does not run on watchOS,
so a real watch app is a second, Swift-only codebase. iOS 18+ mirrors an iPhone
Live Activity into the **watch Smart Stack** for free — the same lock-screen
SwiftUI view, rendered on the wrist. One target, no watchOS project, no second
release path.

**The floor is iOS 17** (the widget target builds at 17.0 for the interactive
heart). `isLiveActivitySupported()` is the only gate; below it the app behaves
exactly as it did before and the OS Now Playing card is untouched.

What is easy to get wrong:

- **`SubwaveLiveAttributes.swift` is compiled twice** — once into the widget, once
  into the Expo module — because the two are different Swift modules and neither
  can import the other. ActivityKit matches an activity to its widget by the type
  NAME, not its module, which is why two copies work; it is the same split Apple's
  own app/extension template has. `npm test` fails if they drift. A mismatched
  `ContentState` does **not** fail the build — the card just silently stops
  rendering on device, which is a miserable thing to debug.
- **`_shared/` is load-bearing.** `LikeTrackIntent.swift` must compile into the
  **main app target** as well as the widget — that is what `_shared/` means to
  `@bacons/apple-targets`, and it is what makes the heart work at all, because a
  `LiveActivityIntent` runs in the app's process (waking it if suspended). If the
  intent ends up in the widget target only, the button does nothing. Confirm the
  generated project lists it under the app target after a prebuild.
- **The widget gets no network turn.** Cover art is downloaded by the app into the
  `group.com.getsubwave.app` container and handed to the widget as a *filename*.
  Miss the App Group entitlement on either side and every cover silently falls
  back to the drawn disc mark.
- **Version lockstep.** App Store Connect rejects an upload whose extension
  `CFBundleShortVersionString` differs from the app's. `eas.json` uses
  `autoIncrement` with remote `appVersionSource`; check the widget target picks up
  the same version on the first production build rather than at submit time.
- **The heart fills on the next feed poll (≤5s), not instantly.** Deliberate: the
  intent hands the tap back to JS so the like goes out through the app's own
  `StationApi` — no station URL and no SecureStore credential in an app extension —
  and the controller rejects a stale tap, so a heart that fills and then un-fills
  would be worse than one that fills a beat late.

Iterate on it like any other native change: `npx expo prebuild -p ios --clean`,
then `xed ios` and pick the **SUB/WAVE Live** scheme — `SubwaveLiveActivity.swift`
carries a `#Preview` so the layout can be worked on without a device. It cannot
run in Expo Go, and the Dynamic Island needs a Pro-class device or the matching
simulator.

## EAS cloud builds (for distributing to testers)

Use EAS when testers can't build locally — TestFlight (iOS) or a shareable
internal APK (Android). `eas.json` already defines the profiles, and the
project is already linked (`extra.eas.projectId` is set in `app.json`); the only
interactive piece left is **auth**, which must be done by the project owner.

### One-time setup (owner runs these)

```bash
npm i -g eas-cli
eas login                 # your Expo account
cd app                    # project is already linked — `eas init` is only
                          # needed again if the owner/projectId ever changes
```

`eas.json` uses `appVersionSource: remote`, so build/version numbers are managed
on the EAS servers (`production` auto-increments) — you don't hand-edit
`ios.buildNumber` / `android.versionCode`.

### Build profiles (already configured in `eas.json`)

| Profile | Output | Account needs |
|---|---|---|
| `development` | dev client, iOS **simulator** | EAS only |
| `development-device` | dev client, physical device | iOS: Apple Developer ($99/yr) for device provisioning |
| `preview` | internal: Android **APK**, iOS non-simulator | Android: none (EAS-managed keystore). iOS: Apple Developer |
| `production` | store builds, auto-incremented | Apple Developer + Play Console |

### Example: shareable Android APK for testers (no Apple account)

```bash
eas build --profile preview --platform android
# EAS returns a URL; testers download + sideload the APK.
```

### Example: iOS TestFlight

```bash
eas build --profile production --platform ios     # needs Apple Developer
eas submit --profile production --platform ios     # uploads to App Store Connect
```

> **OTA is wired up.** `expo-updates` is installed, `app.json` has the `updates`
> block + `runtimeVersion.policy = "fingerprint"`, and `eas.json` gives `preview`
> and `production` a `channel`. JS-only changes ship over-the-air with
> `eas update --channel <channel>` — no new build. Native changes (deps,
> `patches/`, config plugins, `app.json` native sections) still need a store
> build; the fingerprint runtime version guarantees an OTA can't land on a binary
> with mismatched native code. Full decision table + commands: [`RELEASE.md`](./RELEASE.md).

## Known issues / gotchas

- **`patches/react-native-track-player+4.1.2.patch`** is the RNTP new-arch fix
  (2 source files — see "Architecture-critical facts"). It was previously bloated
  to 229 files with accidental Gradle build artifacts; **slimmed to just the 2
  `.kt` source files** (2026-06) and re-verified with a clean `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.
  Keep it lean — never run `patch-package` after a Gradle build has populated
  `node_modules/react-native-track-player/android/build/`, or it recaptures the
  junk.
- **JDK 21 fails the Android build.** Always `JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17`.
- **`LegacySurfaceTexture is not attached!`** in Android logcat is **noise** from
  the Skia visualizer surface, not a crash.
- **Gradle is pinned to 8.14.3** via `plugins/withGradleVersion.js` — RN's
  bundled Gradle plugins reference an API removed in Gradle 9.
- **`expo run:ios` non-interactively prints "Skipping dev server"** and then
  fails the final deep-link open — the build/install still succeeded; just start
  Metro and open via `localhost` (above).
