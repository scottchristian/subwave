# Contributing to SUB/WAVE

Thanks for your interest in SUB/WAVE. It's a small project — contributions,
bug reports, and ideas are all welcome.

## Community content — skills, personas, shows, stations

Community-contributed **DJ skills, personas, shows, and the public station
directory** don't live in this repo. They live in a separate content repo,
**[`getsubwave/community`](https://github.com/getsubwave/community)**,
which every running station fetches **live** — so a merged entry reaches every
station without a software release. To share a skill, persona, or show, or to add
your station to the map, open the matching no-fork issue form there. See
[`docs/community.md`](docs/community.md) for the artifact schemas and the install
flow.

The rest of this guide is for contributing **code** to this (the main) repo.

## Getting set up

See [`README.md`](README.md) for the architecture and [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md)
for deployment. For local development:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d   # Icecast + Liquidsoap + Controller
cd controller && npm install && npm run dev
cd web && npm install && npm run dev     # web UI on :7700
```

Compose files live at the repo root, not under `docker/` — the full set, and what
each deployment shape is for, is in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

All three packages expose `npm run lint` and CI runs all three on every PR.
`controller/` and `web/` also expose `npm test`; `npm test -- <substring>` filters
to matching paths.

- `controller/` — `eslint . && tsc --noEmit`. Tests are `node:test` files under
  `controller/scripts/`, discovered as `*.test.ts`.
- `web/` — `eslint . && tsc --noEmit`. Tests are discovered under `tests/`,
  `components/`, `hooks/`, `lib/` and `scripts/`, as `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx` or
  `*.test.mjs`.
- `mcp-subwave/` — `tsc --noEmit` only. No tests.

**Neither test suite runs in CI**, so run it yourself before pushing: a green
lint says nothing about it. There is no formatter; match the style of the
surrounding code.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:

- what you expected vs. what happened,
- steps to reproduce,
- relevant logs (`docker compose logs -f controller` / `liquidsoap`).

## Pull requests

- Branch off `develop` (the integration branch) and target it in your PR — keep PRs focused on one change.
- Explain the *why*, not just the *what*, in the description.
- If you touch the queue/playback path, `radio.liq`, the crossfade, ducking, or
  the LLM layer, read the relevant note in `CLAUDE.md` first — those areas have
  non-obvious constraints that are easy to regress.
- Don't commit secrets. `.env` files are gitignored; update the `.env.example`
  files instead when you add config.

## Commit messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) so
[`release-please`](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) can maintain
the version and `CHANGELOG.md` automatically. The prefix decides the version
bump and the changelog section:

```
feat: add llama.cpp model switching       # → minor bump, "Features"
fix(ui): handle empty model list          # → patch bump, "Bug Fixes"
docs: update README install steps         # → no bump, "Documentation"
chore: bump deps                          # → no bump, hidden
feat!: rename /request payload field      # → major bump (breaking)
```

A scope in parens (`fix(ui): …`, `feat(controller): …`) is optional but helps
when skimming the changelog. Use `!` after the type, or a `BREAKING CHANGE:`
footer, for anything that breaks compatibility.

PR titles follow the same convention — squash-merging keeps history clean, and
the commit carries through `develop` → `main`, where release-please reads it.

Commits on `develop` are authored by the repo owner and carry no third-party
trailers. That holds when a commit is written, but not in GitHub's squash box,
which prefills the message from every commit on the branch plus the PR body — so
for ordinary PRs squash-merged into `develop`, read that message before
confirming. **The default is to delete the inherited tail**: keep the
conventional PR title as the subject, keep the body you would have written for
the commit yourself, and drop the concatenated branch commit messages under it.
Remove anything that rode in that way — attribution trailers
(`Co-Authored-By:`) and tool or session metadata (`Claude-Session:`,
generated-by footers, session links).

Two things survive the cut: a `Co-Authored-By:` line you are deliberately
keeping to credit a genuine human co-author, and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer the
change actually needs. The release PR is merged rather than squashed, for
reasons of its own — see
[`.claude/skills/subwave-release-pr/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/subwave-release-pr/SKILL.md).

## Releases

You don't cut releases by hand. Maintainers merge `develop` into `main` to ship;
on every push to `main`, the **Release Please**
workflow opens (or updates) a release PR that bumps `package.json` +
`CHANGELOG.md` based on the Conventional Commits since the last tag. Merging
that PR creates a `vX.Y.Z` tag and a GitHub Release, which triggers
`publish-images.yml` to build and push the Docker images to GHCR.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful and constructive. Harassment or abuse of any kind isn't welcome
here. Maintainers may remove comments, commits, or contributors that don't
follow this.
