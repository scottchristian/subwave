# Stem-aware transitions — research & design

*Research notes, July 2026. Status: **Options A and B implemented.** A =
vocal-aware transitions (tail vocal ranges, sung-ending exit shaping,
chop-over-voice veto, never-talk-over-a-singer link gating). B = pair-aware
drain scheduling (`transitions.pairDrain`, the #749 fix), the stem cache
(`audio.stemCache`), and pre-rendered stem-blend seams
(`transitions.stemBlends`, v1 "beat carry" preset). This doc captures how
commercial real-time stem-separation DJ software works under the hood, what
SUB/WAVE has that maps onto it, and the design that was built.*

---

## TL;DR

**The commercial state of the art is real-time AI stem separation.** Leading
DJ apps split any song into vocals / drums / instruments on the fly and build
their mixing features on top: per-stem faders and EQ, instant
acapella/instrumental, and stem-aware automatic transitions. The hard
engineering — a compressed neural net running with near-zero latency on a
phone's neural accelerator — exists only because a human DJ can scratch or
seek anywhere at any moment.

**SUB/WAVE doesn't need the hard part.** A radio station knows its next track
minutes in advance and transitions happen at one known window, so separation
can run *offline, on just the transition windows*, on CPU, with a bigger and
better model than a phone can afford. Roughly half the required stack already
exists in this repo: Demucs ships in the heavy analyzer image, and DJ-mode
transitions already do ending analysis, beat/bar grids, BPM/key compatibility,
and six live transition effects. The missing piece is keeping the stems (today
Demucs runs and then discards everything except vocal-activity timestamps) and
a playback path for a pre-rendered blend.

**Recommended sequence:** [Option A](#option-a--vocal-aware-transitions-ship-first)
(vocal-aware crossfades + talk-over gating — small, reuses every existing pipe)
→ [Option B](#option-b--pre-rendered-stem-transitions-the-flagship) (pre-rendered
stem transitions — the flagship). Options C/D are documented as rejected.

## Part 1 — How the commercial apps do it, layer by layer

Real-time stem mixing isn't one model — it's a four-layer stack. Worth
separating because SUB/WAVE already has equivalents for two of the layers.

### Layer 1: Source separation

Splits any track into three-to-four stems — vocals, drums, bass,
instruments/harmonic — in real time, with no pre-processing or special
encoding (earlier approaches needed specially-mastered multi-track files).
The first generation shipped ports of open-source research models (Spleeter
lineage); current versions license proprietary separation models compressed
hard enough to run on phones — the vendors themselves describe fitting
high-resolution audio separation on-device in real time as the core technical
challenge. Separation quality typically auto-scales in tiers by device
hardware: recent neural-accelerator chips get the full model, older ones a
smaller variant.

### Layer 2: On-device inference optimization

Where most of the commercial engineering goes — and the layer a radio station
can skip entirely. Sample-accurate seeking and scratching means separation
must be computable at any playhead position instantly, so the models are
compiled for the phone's CPU + GPU + neural accelerator with near-zero
claimed latency.

### Layer 3: Musical analysis

- **Dynamic beat grids** that follow tempo fluctuations and interruptions, so
  stems from two decks stay aligned even on non-quantized music.
- Key detection, and time-stretch beat-matching that holds the playing
  track's BPM when the incoming tempo is close.

### Layer 4: Transition intelligence

- **Auto-mix transition-point selection** trained on recordings of human DJs:
  the best intro/outro points, fade durations, and live EQ moves.
- **Stem-aware transition presets** — automation curves binding stem gains +
  filters + effects to crossfader position; e.g. a "harmonic sustain" style
  preset holds the outgoing track's harmonic stem while the incoming track's
  beat takes over. These presets run automatically in auto-mix mode — exactly
  the hands-off radio scenario.

The product features all fall out of these layers: per-stem faders/EQ, instant
acapella/instrumental extraction, per-stem colored waveforms recomputed live,
and vocal-clash-free automatic transitions.

## Part 2 — What SUB/WAVE already has

Mapped from the codebase as of July 2026 (branch `develop`). Load-bearing
facts:

### Separation already ships (but discards its output)

- `subwave-analyzer-heavy` bakes **Demucs `htdemucs`** (`WITH_DEMUCS=1`,
  `demucs==4.0.1`, CPU torch 2.6.0) — see `docker/Dockerfile.analyzer`.
- `controller/scripts/analyze_worker.py` → `VocalActivityDetector`: runs the
  **full 4-stem separation**, keeps only the vocals stem's RMS envelope as
  `vocal_ranges` timestamps, and **discards the drums/bass/other audio
  entirely**. It also only sees the first `ANALYZE_SECONDS` (default 40s) of
  each track — the outro window (last 20s, decoded separately for
  `analyze_outro`) never gets a vocals pass.
- No stem audio is cached anywhere; `state/analyze-tmp/<id>.audio` is deleted
  after each track.

### Layer 3/4 equivalents largely exist

- Per-track BPM, key (Camelot compat math in `controller/src/music/mix.ts`:
  `bpmCompat`, `keyCompat`, `mixCompat`), beat/bar grids (`beats_json`,
  `bars_json`), LUFS normalization (`gainForLoudness`, −14 LUFS target).
- **Ending-aware exit canvas** — the Layer-4 transition-intelligence analog: `outro_json`
  (fade-vs-cold, tail LUFS/tempo/bars) → `endingCrossSecondsFor` stamps each
  DJ-mode track's own crossfade seconds (`queue.applyMixTransition`,
  `controller/src/broadcast/queue.ts`).
- **Six transition effects** — the stem-preset analog, minus stems:
  washout / loop (exit-side) and sweep / dissolve / blend / chop (entry-side),
  synthesized live per-frame inside `dj_transition` (`liquidsoap/radio.liq`),
  driven by per-track `annotate` flags (`liq_washout`, `liq_sweep`, …) built in
  `subsonic.getAnnotatedUri`. The DJ agent proposes the effect; `effectAllowedFor`
  disposes.
- **Liquidsoap 2.4.5** supports per-track cross duration (`liq_cross_duration`,
  already used on every track) and cue points (`liq_cue_out` already used for
  the length cap; `liq_cue_in` is currently unused but is a small `radio.liq`
  change — `cue_cut` at the top of the chain takes both labels).

### Constraints to design within

- Analyzer is **CPU-only** (no CUDA build), **single-request-at-a-time**
  (`StdioWorker` lock in `docker/analyzer/server.py`), 120s per-request budget
  (`ANALYZE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`), 6 GB memory cap, heavy image is amd64-only.
- No scheduled background analysis — passes run via `npm run tag`,
  `npm run analyze`, or admin buttons, single-flight via pidfile lock.
- **The #749 problem** (`queue.ts`, `applyMixTransition` step 1): a *pair-sized*
  crossfade can't be stamped at annotate time because `liq_cross_duration`
  governs the stamped track's own end and the successor is unknown when the
  track is annotated. `crossSecondsFor` (the pair-adaptive blend) is computed
  but deliberately never applied. Any stem-transition design must solve this —
  Option B does, structurally.

---

## Part 3 — Options, ranked

### Option A — Vocal-aware transitions (SHIPPED)

Extends vocal detection to the **outro window**: the tail is already downloaded
and decoded for `analyze_outro`; the existing Demucs pass runs on it too
(~+50% separation time per track, heavy tier only). Tail vocal ranges are
stored inside `outro_json` (`outro.vocalRanges`, absolute ms, `[]` = measured
instrumental tail). As implemented:

1. **Sung-ending exit shaping** — `mixAnalysisFor` derives `Analysis.vocalTail`
   (any tail vocal span overlapping the measured wind-down); a sung fade pulls
   `endingCrossSecondsFor`'s canvas to its 8s floor instead of riding the full
   wind-down under the next track.
2. **Chop-over-voice veto** — `effectAllowedFor` vetoes the chop effect over a
   sung ending (stuttering a voice mid-word), alongside the existing
   chop-over-fade veto.
3. **Never talk over a singer** — `enforceIntroBudget` drops a DJ link outright
   when the incoming track's *measured* first vocal entry is under 2.5s (the
   old lenient guard existed only because the energy heuristic is noise down
   there); `introBudgetPhrase` tells the model to skip the line up front. The
   pool-picker candidate projection also gained the `instrumental` hint the
   agent path already had.
4. **Backfill** — `needsVocalIds` widens to head-analysed/tail-missing tracks,
   gated on the backend's `tail_vocal` capability flag (a stale analyzer image
   never causes churn). No ANALYSIS_VERSION bump.

Note the pair-level piece stays constrained by #749 (a pair-sized crossfade
can't be stamped at annotate time): vocal awareness enters via track-intrinsic
shaping, effect vetoes, and pick steering. Option B dissolves that constraint
properly.

### Option B — Pre-rendered stem transitions (the flagship)

When the DJ agent picks track B while A is still playing (minutes of lookahead),
kick off a render job on the analyzer:

1. **Get window stems** for A's tail (~30s) and B's head (~30s) — from the
   [stem cache](#the-stem-cache-analyzer-change) when present; on a miss,
   fetch the window (the byte-capped ranged download machinery exists —
   `downloadCapped` / worker `fetch_audio`) and separate it on the spot.
2. **Separate** any uncached window with Demucs 4-stem. ~60s of audio on CPU is
   roughly real-time-comparable with `htdemucs` — inside the 120s budget, and
   the lookahead absorbs it; with warm cache this step is skipped entirely and
   the job is a fast mix. (New worker op, reusing the already-loaded model
   from `VocalActivityDetector`; better: a single `transition-render` op that
   does separate + align + mix server-side and returns a WAV path on the shared
   volume, so no stem audio ever crosses a boundary.)
3. **Align** using the stored beat/bar grids. Gate on `bpmCompat` — only
   stem-mix when tempos are within a few percent or a clean half/double.
   (Rubberband micro-stretch is a later enhancement, not a prerequisite.)
4. **Render a blend** from a preset — e.g. *harmonic sustain* (hold A's "other"
   stem while B's drums enter), *beat carry* (A's drums loop under B's intro),
   *acapella out* (A's vocal rides alone over B's intro) — normalize to
   −14 LUFS, small overlap fades at the seams, write one WAV.
5. **Queue** through the existing single-writer (`queue.push` →
   `drainToLiquidsoap`): A with `liq_cue_out` at the blend start, the rendered
   clip as its own queue item, B with `liq_cue_in` past the pre-mixed head,
   near-zero `liq_cross_duration` at the clip seams. The clip must not fire
   now-playing as its own track (annotate it to carry B's metadata, or suppress
   and let B's cue-in metadata land).

Why this shape is right:

- **Skips Layer 2 entirely** — no real-time model, no latency
  engineering, and the model can be *better* than a phone's: current
  open-source SOTA (BS-RoFormer / Mel-Band RoFormer, ~11–12 dB vocal SDR vs
  htdemucs' ~9) is available via ZFTurbo's MSST repo as a future quality tier.
- **Structurally solves #749** — the render job runs after *both* tracks are
  known, so the pair-sized transition becomes a file and the
  annotate-time-successor-unknown problem disappears.
- **Degrades the house way** — any render failure/timeout falls back to the
  normal `dj_transition` path, exactly like TTS falls back to Piper. Gate on
  the heavy analyzer's capability flag + DJ mode + an admin toggle (the
  `archive_enabled` opt-in pattern).

Design points as RESOLVED in the implementation:

- `liq_cue_in` needed **no radio.liq change** — Liquidsoap 2.4.x reads both
  cue labels natively from `annotate:` at request resolution (an earlier
  draft of this doc wrongly assumed a `cue_cut` edit was required).
- Rendered *clips* are single-use seam artifacts — not cached; swept after
  an hour like TTS WAVs (`broadcast/stem-blend.ts cleanupOldClips`).
- Preset selection is v1-deterministic (data-gated "beat carry" only); the
  agent-proposed `transition:`-style choice is a future increment.
- The enabling architecture is the **pair-aware drain** (`transitions.pairDrain`,
  `broadcast/drain-policy.ts`): picks are held unsent until their successor
  is known (deadline-picked ~120s before the on-air track's effective end,
  hard fallback at ~45s), which is also what finally applies the pair-sized
  `crossSecondsFor` — closing #749 for every DJ-mode seam, blended or not.

### Stem-seam validation

The worker's `blendStartSec` is the actual clip start. The controller's
`outCueSec` is the outgoing playback cut, one 0.3-second overlap later;
the incoming cue is one overlap before the worker's hand-off point.
Queue recovery migrates the former `stemBlend.blendStartSec` field to
`outCueSec` without changing its persisted value.

The cue correction in #1775 depends on #1774's mixer buffer-sizing fix.
Merge and ship #1774 first, or ship both together. Without that mixer fix,
station crossfades of 0 or 0.1 seconds can shorten a clip seam below its
0.3-second stamp, so compensating for 0.3 seconds still leaves a stutter.

`bash scripts/stem-seam-test.sh` renders synthetic tracks through the real
worker and the production annotation writers, `cue_cut`, `dj_transition`
and `cross` wiring. It lifts mixer code directly from `liquidsoap/radio.liq`
and checks 0, 0.1 and the mixer default, including an ordinary predecessor
whose duration stamp can affect a broken mixer's buffers. It checks both
buffer sizes and beat intervals, with a 25ms tolerance for audio frames.

For combined validation before either PR is merged, fetch the final #1774
commit and run `STEM_SEAM_RADIO_REF=<commit-sha> bash scripts/stem-seam-test.sh`.
This reads that commit's mixer directly without merging or copying its
implementation into #1775. The output identifies the exact mixer SHA and
keeps the rendered scripts, WAVs and logs under `scripts/.fx-render/stemseam/`.
Controller dependencies and Python with numpy and soundfile are required;
Liquidsoap defaults to the production `savonet/liquidsoap:v2.4.5` image.

### The stem cache (analyzer change)

The separation cost mostly disappears if the analyzer stops throwing its work
away. Two facts make this cheap:

1. **The head stems are already computed.** When vocal detection runs at tag
   time (heavy tier), Demucs produces all four stems for the first 40s — the
   track's *head*, exactly the window Option B needs from the incoming track —
   and then discards everything except the vocals RMS envelope. Writing those
   stems to disk as a side effect of the existing pass is near-zero extra
   compute.
2. **The tail audio is already downloaded.** Outro analysis decodes the last
   ~20s of every complete file; running Demucs on that window too is an
   incremental step (~+50% separation time per track, heavy tier only, and
   only on complete downloads — the same rule outro analysis follows).

With both windows cached, the pick-time render drops from "separate two
windows, then mix" (~a minute of CPU) to "mix cached stems" (seconds), and the
single-in-flight analyzer worker stops being a contention concern — the heavy
step moved into the one-time analysis pass.

**What we deliberately do NOT keep: the raw download.** It's byte-capped at
12 MiB (often incomplete), Navidrome can serve it again anytime, and fetching
is the cheap step. `state/analyze-tmp/<id>.audio` keeps its delete-after-track
behaviour. Stems only.

**Disk math** (why the cache is capped/opt-in, not unconditional):

| Storage | Per track (2 windows × 4 stems, ~60s) | 5k-track library |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw WAV | ~42 MB | ~210 GB — no |
| FLAC | ~25 MB | ~125 GB — no |
| Opus 160–192k per stem | ~6–8 MB | ~30–40 GB — viable opt-in |

Lossy stems are fine here: they get remixed and re-encoded to the stream codec
anyway.

**Recommended shape:** an LRU cache under `state/stems/<id>/`, size-capped in
settings. Populated two ways: opportunistically at tag time (head stems free,
tail stems the +50% increment, gated on the same heavy-tier opt-in as vocal
detection) and lazily on first use (a cache miss at render time separates on
the spot and stores the result). A radio station replays a mood-shaped subset
of the library heavily, so even a few-GB cache hits constantly. Backfill works
like the existing `--vocal` backfill: already-analyzed tracks get stems on a
re-analysis pass or lazily on first use.

The cache changes the render job's *cost*, not its existence — the blend is a
pair artifact and the pair is only known at pick time.

### Option C — Live per-stem buses in Liquidsoap (rejected)

The commercial apps' actual architecture: pre-separate whole tracks, cache 4 stems per song,
play 4 sample-aligned sources per deck with stem-gain automation in
`dj_transition`. Rejected: 4× library disk, full-file separation cost, fragile
multi-queue sample alignment in Liquidsoap — for no audible benefit over
Option B in a non-interactive stream.

### Option D — Real-time separation on the live bus (rejected)

The capability that only exists because a human can scratch. CPU-only
Docker can't do it, and radio lookahead makes it pointless.

## Naming note

Commercial vendors hold patents and trademarks around real-time stem-mixing
features. This implementation is a materially different approach —
open-source, server-side, offline-rendered — and the feature carries its own
names throughout ("stem blends", "pair-aware transitions"). Keep commercial
product names out of UI copy and docs.
