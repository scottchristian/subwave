# Private station mode

SUB/WAVE is public by default: anyone with the address can open the player and
anyone who guesses `/stream.mp3` can listen. If you'd rather keep your station
to yourself (issue #478), **admin → Settings → Station → Privacy** gives you
two independent locks.

Both locks share **one station password**, set in the same place. Turning on
either lock requires a password first.

## Private player (UI lock)

Swaps the public web pages (`/`, `/listen`) for a password prompt. Type the
station password and the player appears as normal; the browser remembers it.
The SUB/WAVE app shows the same prompt in place of its player. `/admin` and
`/onboarding` keep working (the admin console keeps its own separate sign-in).
Applies live — no restart.

This only hides the interface. The now-playing JSON endpoints stay public
(the player and admin dash rely on them), and the stream URL still works —
for actual gating you want the stream password too.

## Stream password (the real boundary)

Turns on Icecast listener authentication for every mount (`/stream.mp3`,
`/stream.opus`, `/stream.flac`, `/stream.aac`). The same station password, for
all listeners — Icecast only speaks HTTP basic auth, so there are no per-user
accounts (and no OIDC; that's not viable for a live audio stream).

How it works under the hood: the controller writes
`state/icecast_listener_auth.txt`, and on the next broadcast restart the
Icecast config gains per-mount `<authentication type="url">` blocks pointing
at the controller's `POST /listener-auth`. Icecast asks the controller on
every listener connect, so:

- **Enabling/disabling needs a mixer restart** (the admin UI tells you, same
  as the Opus/AAC toggles).
- **Password changes apply live** — the controller validates each connect
  against the current settings.
- **If the controller is down, new listeners can't connect** (fail closed);
  already-connected listeners keep playing.

### Tuning in with a password

- **Web player** — asks for the password once and remembers it in the
  browser. If the private player is on too, the single prompt unlocks both the
  interface and the audio. Under the hood it rides a `?auth=PASSWORD` token on
  the stream URL (browsers can't attach basic auth to an `<audio>` element).
- **Radio apps / VLC / Sonos / hardware** — use a credentialed URL:
  `https://listener:PASSWORD@your-station.example/stream.mp3`
  (any username works; only the password is checked).
- **Anything that can't do userinfo URLs** — append the token instead:
  `https://your-station.example/stream.mp3?auth=PASSWORD`.
- **SUB/WAVE app** — asks for the password when it opens a station with
  either lock on, checks it with the station, and keeps it in the device's
  secure storage (separate from any **Station login**). Like the web player it
  rides the stream as `?auth=`, so Google Cast works too. A listener who had
  followed earlier advice and typed the stream password into **Station login**
  is recognised and not asked again. If the password is later rotated, the app
  asks again the next time the station is opened, or once playback stalls.

While the password is on, `/listen.pls` and `/listen.m3u` return 403 — they
would otherwise hand out credential-less URLs that no longer play.

## A different thing: HTTP Basic Auth in front of the whole station

Everything above is SUB/WAVE's *own* privacy lock. Plenty of operators instead
put **HTTP Basic Auth on the reverse proxy** (nginx `auth_basic`, Caddy
`basic_auth`, Traefik's `BasicAuth` middleware), which gates the admin UI, the
player, the API and the streams in one go — before a request ever reaches the
controller.

> Identity proxies like **Cloudflare Access** are a different mechanism and are
> **not** supported by the apps: they authenticate with an SSO session cookie
> (or `CF-Access-Client-*` service-token headers), not HTTP Basic Auth, so
> there is no Basic Auth username/password pair for the app to send. Everything
> below is about plain basic auth.

Plain basic auth works in both mobile apps. Enter the public station address,
open **Station login**, then fill in the username and password. The app takes
two different routes with those credentials, which is worth knowing when
something half-works:

- **API polls and cover artwork** receive an in-memory credentialed request URL.
  RN's `fetch` and `<Image>` sit on NSURLSession / OkHttp, which answer the
  server's basic-auth challenge from that userinfo.
- **The audio stream** gets a credential-free URL plus an explicit
  `Authorization: Basic` header, because **iOS's AVPlayer silently drops
  `user:pass@` userinfo from a media URL** (and Android's player is no more
  reliable about it). That is why a basic-auth station could report *Stream
  Unreachable* / HTTP 401 in the app while the exact same URL played fine in a
  browser, in VLC and via `curl` (#764).

Three things to know:

- **The station URL is stored without credentials.** The username and password
  live in this device's iOS Keychain or Android Keystore-backed secure storage.
  It is still a shared listening password, not an account — don't reuse a
  password that matters.
- **An authenticated bare address never falls back silently to HTTP.** Type an
  explicit `http://` address if a trusted station really has no TLS; the app
  asks before it sends the login over cleartext.
- **Google Cast is unavailable** for a station with a saved login (the cast
  button doesn't appear). A Chromecast fetches the stream itself, and it has no
  way to send the header. SUB/WAVE's own stream password is not affected:
  entered at the app's private-station prompt, it rides the stream URL.
- **Special characters need no percent-encoding in the fields.** Type the real
  username and password, including `@` or `:`.

Older app versions accepted `https://user:pass@host` addresses. On upgrade,
the app removes that userinfo from the saved station URL and migrates the
decoded credentials into secure storage.

Basic auth on the proxy and SUB/WAVE's own stream password are independent and
can be combined, but there's rarely a reason to: the proxy lock is broader
(it covers admin too) while the stream password is what lets you hand a
listener the stream without handing them the console.

## Known limits

- One shared password for both locks; rotating it logs every listener out
  (web and app listeners get re-prompted automatically).
- Metadata endpoints (`/api/now-playing`, `/api/state`) stay public.
- The landing broadsheet (`/landing`) is not gated — it exists to market a
  station, which is at odds with private mode; leave `SUBWAVE_HOMEPAGE=player`
  (the default) on a private install.
- The `?auth=` token appears in Icecast's access log on your own box.
