"""
subwave-analyzer — acoustic-analysis sidecar for SUB/WAVE.

A thin FastAPI shim over a bounded pool of long-lived subprocesses: the SAME
stdio worker the controller runs in-process
(controller/scripts/analyze_worker.py), speaking one
JSON object per line ({"ready": true} once loaded, then one response per
request). run() supervises it — start → wait-for-exit → respawn — so a crash
(OOM, fatal model error) recovers without bouncing the container. No audio
over the wire: the worker reads tracks from a stream URL or a path on the
shared /var/sub-wave volume.

Endpoints:
  GET  /health   → {ok, engines, analyze_loaded, analyze_audio_capable, analyze_vocal_capable}
  POST /analyze  → {ok, bpm, key, intro_ms, confidence, ...}
