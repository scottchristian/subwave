// The Gemini Extended Voice Library — the ~2,000 prebuilt voices BEYOND the 30
// featured studio ones in GEMINI_TTS_VOICES.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE CATALOGUE
// ---------------------------------
// GEMINI_TTS_VOICES is Google's documented list of *30 featured studio voices*
// (Zephyr…Sulafat). Google separately exposes ~2,089 *prebuilt* voices through
// GET /v1beta/voices — different ids (`en-us-varo`, not `Varo`), richer
// metadata (language, accent, gender, pitch, persona, context), and paginated.
// An operator browsing AI Studio's "2,000+ voices" picker is looking at THIS
// one. Verified against the live API: `{"voice":"Varo"}` and
// `{"voice":"en-us-varo"}` both synthesise, while a nonsense name 400s with
// "No matching speaker voice found" — so Google VALIDATES rather than silently
// falling back, which is what makes the membership test below worth having.
//
// WHY GENDER AND ACCENT ARE FILTERS HERE AND NOT STYLE TEXT
// ---------------------------------------------------------
// Google is explicit: "Do not try to change immutable speaker traits in style:
// avoid putting age, gender, names, or permanent accent changes in
// speech_metadata.style. Instead, pick a regional voice from the Extended Voice
// Library." So the operator picks a voice that HAS the trait; there is no
// directive form to offer, and offering one would be a control that silently
// does nothing. Also note the accent vocabulary is NOT "Australian" — the live
// values are things like "Sydney English" (44 en-AU voices all carry it), which
// is why nothing here hardcodes a list of accents or languages.
//
// The vocabulary is discovered, never restated: `facets()` returns the distinct
// values actually present in a page, so the admin dropdown cannot drift from
// what Google currently serves.

// index is populated from what Google actually SERVED and nothing else.

// restart would silently swap a persona back to the station voice.

// A filter menu is a vocabulary, not a summary of the current results. Deriving
// it from the returned page made the menu depend on the filter: on first open
// the unfiltered page yielded THREE accents, and "Sydney English" was simply not
// an option — so an Australian station could not select it. Narrowing by gender
// first changed the page, the menu repopulated, and 10 more accents appeared
// including the one being looked for. Measured, not hypothesised: 3 accents
// unfiltered vs 13 after gender=male.
//
// The whole-catalogue walk that fills the membership index above already sees
// every row, so the vocabulary is collected there at no extra cost. This is the
// same reasoning as GEMINI_TTS_VOICES: derived from what Google serves, never
// restated, because the vocabulary moves.
