  // ------------------------------------------------------
  // The guide lists `<whispers> / <whispering>` as a PAIR OF ALTERNATIVES in the

  // version of this comment claimed Google classes whispering as "a sustained
  // modifier of the following speech"; that was our own reading, not Google's
  // instruction, and it was cited as though it were sourced. Corrected.
  //
  // So the mapping is deliberately flat and literal: every documented spelling
  // emits ITSELF, and `<whispers>` is reachable as `<whispers>` rather than
  // being credited to `<whispering>` by the inflection stripper. That matters
  // because the coverage test used to accept "some tag" as proof of reachability
  // — under which `[whispers]` counted as coverage for `<whispers>` while
  // emitting `<whispering>`, and a missing mapping read as a passing suite.
  // The test now asserts exact input -> output identities.
  //
  // `whispering` is the one spelling routed to `speech_metadata.style` instead.
  // That is a STATION CHOICE, and it is deliberate: it is the gerund, and it is
  // the spelling the guide's own scope table lists among turn-level style
  // examples ("whispers", "whispered"). It is recorded here as our routing, not
  // as something the provider requires — the guide lists it as a tag too, so
  // nothing guarantees the style channel is the better one for it.

// Persona character → `speech_metadata.style`, the same composition OpenAI gets
// through `instructions` (deliveryHint in llm/internal/speech/cloud-speech.ts).
// Before this, Gemini received the persona's `voiceStyle` and nothing else, so a
// persona's whole `soul` — the backstory, the job, the running jokes — never
// reached the model. A station running Gemini therefore had to hardcode a
// short style per persona to get any characterisation at all.
//
// Deliberately NOT identical to OpenAI's version, for two documented reasons:
//
// 1. LENGTH. OpenAI accepts a 4096-char `instructions` string. Gemini's
//    prompting guide is the opposite advice: "Long-form 'Audio Profile'
//    paragraphs and multi-bullet 'Director's Notes' ... are the most common
//    cause of voice drift", and it steers operators toward a designed voice
//    plus a short per-turn tweak. So the budget is spent the other way round —
//    the operator's explicit `voiceStyle` is allocated FIRST and the soul
//    excerpt fills whatever is left. Ordering it OpenAI's way (character, then
//    style) would let the soul excerpt eat the entire budget and silently drop
//    the one field the operator deliberately wrote.
// 2. LANGUAGE. OpenAI has no language parameter, so the language directive has
//    to be spelled out inside `instructions`. Gemini detects the input language
//    automatically, so repeating it would fight the detector rather than help
//    it — it is deliberately absent here.
// The station's own pronunciation note, read at call time rather than threaded
// through every caller. It is station-wide and constant for the life of the
// process — the single strongest argument for not making it a parameter, since a
// threaded copy is a value every future caller has to remember to pass.
