// A pool of Google API keys with per-key holds, shared by the Gemini LLM leg
// and (once #1718's engine is wired up) Gemini TTS.
//
// Why a pool and not a rotation: free-tier keys are cheap and plentiful, and a
// station running one exhausts its daily quota long before it notices. The
// behaviour wanted is fail-forward — use key 1 until it stops working, park it
// for as long as Google says, move to key 2, and only fall through to the
// station's configured backup leg when the whole pool is spent.
//
// Selection is deliberately PRIMARY-FIRST rather than round-robin. Key 1 keeps
// its quota for as long as possible, and the operator's first key stays the one
// that gets tested and reported on.
//
// Holds are IN MEMORY. A controller restart re-probes keys that are still
// exhausted; they are re-parked from the same 429 within one call, which is
// cheaper than a second writer on the state dir and than persisting a wall-clock
// that is meaningless to a key whose quota resets on Google's schedule, not
// ours.
//
// Absent configuration, EVERY function here is a no-op and the module is
// invisible: an upgraded station with one key behaves exactly as before.
