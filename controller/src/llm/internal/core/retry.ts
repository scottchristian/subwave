// limiting a 429 commonly tell the caller exactly how long to wait (OpenAI,
// Anthropic, Groq all send it); honouring it instead of a blind fixed delay
// (issue #738) means a same-leg retry actually lands after the window clears
// rather than guessing and burning the retry budget on another 429. Returns
// the RAW duration, uncapped — the caller compares it against
// MAX_RETRY_AFTER_MS and gives up on the leg (→ withFailover tries the backup)
// rather than clamping a per-day reset window down to something waitable.
// Unwraps AI_RetryError first: after the SDK's own retries the header lives on
// the wrapped APICallError, not the wrapper (PR #751 review). OpenAI also
// sends the ms-precision `retry-after-ms`; prefer it when present.

// withFailover can try the configured backup leg NOW (issue #738). Kept well
// under the 45s default agent deadline (settings.llm.agentTimeoutMs) so an
// honoured wait can't blow the deadline and surface as AgentDeadlineError,
// which matches no failover classifier (PR #751 review).

// Ollama — and anything proxying it — produces occasional 502/503/504 and TCP
// resets, especially on slow models with fat prompts. Without retry, one blip
// kills a station ID or hourly check (see issue #140). Two retries with
// jittered backoff is enough — beyond that the upstream is genuinely down and
// the failure should surface.
//
// A Retry-After header on the error overrides the fixed delay (jitter is kept
// so a fleet of callers released by the same header doesn't stampede back in
// sync); a header LONGER than MAX_RETRY_AFTER_MS aborts same-leg retry
// entirely — the error propagates to withFailover, which fails over to the
// backup leg instead of sleeping out the provider's reset window here.
//
// `signal` (optional, threaded from withDeadline by djAgent's runDeadlined)
// cuts the backoff sleep short and stops further attempts once the deadline
// has fired — without it the loop would sleep through the abort and launch a
// ghost attempt whose result nobody is waiting on.
//
// Schema/parse failures and the agent's "did not call done" condition are NOT
// transient and bubble straight out — they need different recovery paths.

// Hard wall-clock ceiling on a single agent generation (including its

// reasoning-locked cloud model that never reaches the tool call just runs
// until its output budget is spent (observed at 60s+ per pick on
// minimax-m2.7:cloud while the caller believed it was capped at 22s). The
// race here is the guarantee; the AbortSignal is passed through as well so
// transports that DO support cancellation stop the request server-side
// instead of leaving it burning an inference slot.
//
// The deadline error deliberately does NOT look host-unreachable (its name
// matches neither isUnreachable's name checks nor its message regex): a model
// that overthinks past the deadline is not a host that's down, so the call
// must fall back to the caller's stateless path, not fail over to the backup
// leg on a different model.
//
// This is also why the AI SDK's structured timeout (totalMs/stepMs/chunkMs)
// is NOT used for the wall clock: it aborts with a DOMException named
// 'TimeoutError', which isTransient AND isUnreachable both match — an
// overthink would burn same-leg retries and then wrongly fail over. Only the
// SDK's toolMs is adopted (strategy/agent.ts): a tool timeout surfaces as a
// tool-error result the model can react to, never a thrown classifier-visible
// error. Adopting stepMs later needs a rewrap here that renames the error
// first.
