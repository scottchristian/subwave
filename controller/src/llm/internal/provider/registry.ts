 * The Google transport, and where key rotation happens.
 *
 * Two jobs, in this order:
 *
 *  1. Stamp `x-goog-api-key` with whichever pooled key is currently live, so
 *     ONE cached client serves the whole pool. The alternative — rebuilding the
 *     provider per key — invalidates the client cache on every rotation and
 *     drops the per-provider headers captured at construction.
 *
 *  2. Rotate ON a quota 429: park the exhausted key for as long as Google
 *     asked, then re-issue the same request with the next key.
 *
 * Rotating here rather than in withTransientRetry is deliberate. In the retry
 * layer a 429 would either sleep on the key that just refused (burning the
 * agent deadline on a key whose quota is gone until tomorrow) or escalate
 * straight to the backup leg, skipping the nine other keys entirely. Doing it
 * at the transport means the SDK's own retry budget never observes the 429,
 * `withTransientRetry` and `withFailover` are untouched, and rotation composes
 * with the existing dead-air fallbacks for free.
 *
 * Safe to re-send: every request through here is a model generation (LLM
 * prompt or TTS render), both idempotent, so a repeat costs tokens and nothing
 * else. Bounded by the pool — each recursion parks a key, so the depth is the
 * pool size and `currentKey()` returning the same key ends it.
 *
 * With no pool configured this is exactly the SDK's own transport, so an
 * unconfigured station is byte-identical to before.

 * variable `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` and throws `LoadAPIKeyError` if that
 * is also unset — it never looks at the pool. Passing `apiKey` only when
 * `cfg.apiKey` was set therefore broke the exact configuration the feature is
 * for: a pool-only station (no singular variable at all) failed every chat
 * generation and every embedding with ZERO fetch calls, so the pooled
 * transport never ran. googleKeyFetch re-stamps the real per-request key on

 * Test seam: forget every built client.

 * a Google client can be handed the one an EARLIER test built — same
 * configuration, same signature — and then assert against a client whose
 * construction it never triggered. That is how "a client can be built while every
 * key is held" passed against the broken code: the cached client short-circuited
 * `googleApiKeyForSdk` entirely, so the branch under test was never reached.
 *
 * A distinct model id would dodge it too, but invisibly and only for that test.
 * Clearing the cache states the precondition outright.
