// parses as a cue for what they are hearing. So the rule bans the cue framing
// rather than the title: a feature on the birth of grunge that cannot name
// Nevermind is not a feature. Certainty is asked for as a SEPARATE half, and
// that half is what covers a genuinely invented credit or date — the two
// failure modes are independent and a rule for one does not cover the other.
