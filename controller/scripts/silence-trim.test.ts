// music/silence-trim.ts — the dead-air trim policy: which measured edge gaps
// become liq_cue_in / liq_cue_out, and how a trimmed head shifts every onset
// the analyzer measured from byte zero.
//
// Two things are pinned here that a formula-shaped test would miss:
//
//  1. A COLD-LOAD round trip on `settings.silenceTrim`. load()'s composition is
//     explicit and does not spread DEFAULTS, so a new key that update() happily
//     writes to settings.json vanishes on the next restart with nothing in the
//     logs (#1317, #1327). An in-process assertion passes on that bug.
//  2. The three guards' DIRECTIONS. Every one of them is a "cut less than the
//     measurement said" rule, and each fails silently in the expensive
//     direction — a min-gap that stops filtering eats a segued album's
//     deliberate space, a lost margin cuts the attack, a lost ceiling lets one
//     bad measurement halve a song.
//
// No audio, no library DB: tracks carry their own measurements so the library
// fallback is never reached HERE. That fallback is the path every real caller
// actually takes, and it has its own file — scripts/silence-trim-library.test.ts.
// Keep the split: this file is the arithmetic, that one is the plumbing, and a
// break in the plumbing is invisible to every assertion below.
