// voiceStyle delivery directive.
//
// Contracts:
//   • `gemini` is a first-class engine id in the persona + skill vocabularies
//     (restated lists stay equal — same posture as the tag regexes).
//   • splitCues: vocal bursts become <...> tags (inflected forms included, or
//     Gemini 3.8 reads "laughs" aloud — its `text` is a verbatim transcript),
//     delivery modifiers and free-text cues join speech_metadata.style, and
//     capitalised track-title brackets survive.
//   • fallbackTextFor strips brackets for gemini rescues (it speaks literally).
//   • Gemini is presented as a CLOUD PROVIDER, not a peer engine card, while
//     keeping its own engine id end to end (see the fold block at the bottom).
//
// Run: `npm test -- gemini-tts`.
