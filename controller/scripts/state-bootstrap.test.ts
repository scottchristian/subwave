// Regression tests for the shared-state bootstrap in the two supervisors
// (docker/broadcast-entrypoint.sh and docker/aio/supervisor.sh:
// bootstrap_state_dirs).
//
// #1300 bug 10. The bootstrap creates the state subdirs and chmod 777s them,
// because the controller and analyzer containers write here as OTHER uids and
// operators shouldn't have to chown a bind-mount source before first boot. The
// broadcast entrypoint runs under `set -eu`, so every one of those mkdir/chmod
// calls was load-bearing: a state path on a mount that refuses the change —
// a read-only bind, an NFS export without the right perms, exFAT/NTFS on the
// cheap big disk people move the stem cache to — aborted the entrypoint BEFORE
// icecast started. Compose then reports `dependency failed to start: container
// sub-wave-broadcast is unhealthy`, which names neither the path nor the chmod.
// Measured on subwave-broadcast:latest with a read-only mount at
// /var/sub-wave/archive: exit=1, health=unhealthy, one line of output.
//
// The station has no business refusing to boot over a permission convenience.
// The load-bearing properties, in order of what they protect:
//   1. An unusable path NEVER aborts the bootstrap — the remaining dirs are
//      still prepared and the caller still reaches icecast. A supervisor that
//      won't start is strictly worse than one running on a degraded mount:
//      icecast still serves and the dead-air guard still airs the emergency
//      loop, but an exited container airs nothing.
//   2. It WARNS, naming the path. The whole cost of this bug was a symptom
//      three layers from its cause; a warning naming the dir is the fix for
//      that, and it has to survive into `docker logs`.
//   3. A dir that exists and is world-writable is SILENT even if chmod could
//      not be applied. chmod 777 is the means; writability by the other uids
//      is the end. Warning on an already-correct mount trains operators to
//      ignore the line that matters.
//   4. The happy path stays silent, because this runs on every boot.
//
// Both supervisors are driven here from ONE table: they carry the same block
// for the same reason, and the AIO's copy (which runs under `set -u`, so it
// only ever printed a raw `chmod:` error) drifting away from the broadcast
// one is how this class comes back.
//
// Run: `tsx scripts/state-bootstrap.test.ts`.
//
// node:assert-via-tsx style, matching scripts/aio-analyzer-heavy.test.ts.
