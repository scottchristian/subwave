// Pins skillCronAllowed() (broadcast/scheduler.ts) — the gate a per-skill cron
// timer checks before calling runCapability() directly.
//
// The bug: a cron-registered skill bypassed every station-wide autonomous-talk
// gate skillsTick applies (voice off, mid-programme, no listeners, over the
// daily token budget) — CLAUDE.md's carve-out for "manual /dj/segment command
// routes" is explicitly for an EXPLICIT OPERATOR ACTION, and a scheduled timer
// firing on its own is not one. Left ungated, a cron skill would still speak
// and spend tokens with `tts.enabled: false` set, past the daily LLM hard cap,
// with zero listeners, and mid-episode.
//
// skillCronAllowed() takes its four inputs as an explicit object rather than
// reading autoVoiceAllowed()/programme.onAir()/djCallsAllowed()/
// optionalSegmentsAllowed() itself, so the rule can be pinned here without
// needing to fake real settings/listener/budget/programme state — the same
// split as budgetMode({used, cap, softPct}) in dj-budget.ts.
//
// Run: `tsx scripts/skill-cron-gates.test.ts`.
