// music/silence-trim.ts — the LIBRARY-LOOKUP half of the dead-air trim.
//
// Split out from silence-trim.test.ts, which pins the policy arithmetic on
// tracks that carry their own measurements. That shape is the exception. In
// production NOTHING hands resolveSilenceTrim a track object with
// leadSilenceMs/tailSilenceMs on it: Subsonic songs have no such fields, and
// neither library projection that builds a pick candidate (library.slimTrack,
// the auto.m3u pool) carries them. Every real caller — the queue drain, the
// auto.m3u rewrite, the /now-playing clock — arrives with an id and recovers
// the measurement through library.get().
//
// So the projection IS the feature. library.get() is a hand-written field list,
// and a column missing from it doesn't degrade the trim, it disables it: the
// resolver reads undefined, treats it as "not measured", and stamps nothing
// however the operator sets the dial — with the analysis sitting in the row all
// along. That shipped once (the fields were added to the schema, the row mapper
// and the writer, but not to the projection) and no assertion in the policy
// suite could see it, because none of them went through a DB.
//
// This file goes through the DB on purpose. It is deliberately end-to-end from
// upsertTrackAnalysis to the cue points.
